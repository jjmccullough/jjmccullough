Like all Canadians, I possess an insatiable need to explain my country to foreigners. In high school, I made a website called <b>J.J.’s Complete Guide to Canada</b> for the benefit of some of my internet friends, and I’ve basically been updating it ever since.

Today, <b><a href="http://thecanadaguide.com/">thecanadaguide.com</a></b> features over 100 articles offering an insider’s perspective on all aspects of life in Canada, from food to politics to history to geography to urban legends, written in a casual yet informative style. It is today one of the top Google-ranked pages on Canada.
